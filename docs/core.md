# Core

The two functions, register and run form the backbone of the extension building system.

## Register

Register should be placed on every function that you want to function as a node. The function will be the entry
point for the node's computation.

```{eval-rst}
.. currentmodule:: oloren.server
.. autofunction:: register
```

## Server

Register should be placed on every function that you want to function as a node. The function will be the entry
point for the node's computation.

Run should be placed at the bottom of your configuration file.

```{eval-rst}
.. currentmodule:: oloren.server
.. autofunction:: run
```
